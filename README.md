## Authentication Architecture

### Middleware Implementation

This project follows Supabase's recommended approach for authentication with Next.js App Router:

1. **Simple Middleware**: We use the standard middleware approach recommended by Supabase, which focuses solely on refreshing the authentication session and managing cookies:

```typescript
// middleware.ts
import { type NextRequest } from 'next/server'
import { updateSession } from './utils/supabase/middleware'

export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  return await updateSession(request)
}
```

2. **Route Protection**: We protect routes at the page/layout level rather than in middleware:
   - `(main)` layout checks for authentication and redirects unauthenticated users to sign-in
   - Authentication pages redirect authenticated users to the dashboard

This approach simplifies the codebase and aligns with Supabase's best practices, ensuring easier maintenance and compatibility with Supabase updates.

### User Authentication Flow

1. **Sign-in/Sign-up**: User authenticates through the auth pages
2. **Session Refresh**: Middleware handles session cookie refresh automatically
3. **Route Access**: Protected routes check for valid authentication before rendering

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- A Supabase account and project

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
# Supabase configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

### Supabase Setup

1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Set up email authentication with magic links
3. Create the following tables:

```sql
-- Income statements table
CREATE TABLE income_statements (
  id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users NOT NULL,
  user_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  user_email TEXT NOT NULL,
  statement_data JSONB NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);

-- Set up Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE income_statements ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy to allow users to only see their own statements
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own statements"
  ON income_statements
  FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Create policy to allow users to insert their own statements
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own statements"
  ON income_statements
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Deployment

### Deploying to Vercel

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository

2. Visit the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard) and click "New Project"

3. Import your repository and configure the following settings:
   - Framework Preset: Next.js
   - Root Directory: `./` (default)

4. Add the following environment variables:
   ```
   # Supabase configuration
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
   
   # Base URL (will be used for auth redirects)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-vercel-deployment-url.vercel.app
   ```

5. Click "Deploy"

### Configuring Supabase for Production

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to Authentication â†’ URL Configuration
3. Update the Site URL to match your Vercel deployment URL
4. Add the redirect URL: `https://your-vercel-deployment-url.vercel.app/auth/callback`
5. Save changes

### Verifying Your Deployment

After deployment:
1. Test authentication flow by signing in
2. Verify that redirection works correctly after authentication
3. Test creating and viewing income statements

### Troubleshooting Deployment Issues

#### Authentication Problems
- **Redirect Loop**: If you're experiencing redirect loops, verify that your `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is set correctly and matches your actual deployment URL.
- **Magic Link Not Working**: Check that your Supabase redirect URL is correctly configured in the Supabase dashboard.
- **Cookie Issues**: Ensure cookies are working on your domain. For custom domains, make sure they're properly set up in Vercel.

#### Environment Variables
- Make sure all environment variables are properly set in the Vercel dashboard.
- For local testing of production builds, create a `.env.production.local` file with the same variables.
- Verify that the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix is used for all client-side variables.

#### Supabase Connection Issues
- Check that your Supabase project is on a plan that supports your expected traffic.
- Verify network rules if you're experiencing timeouts or connection issues.
- Test Supabase connection using the auth debug route: `/auth-debug`

#### Deployment Fails
- Check Vercel build logs for specific errors.
- Ensure your Node.js version is compatible (this project requires Node.js 18+).
- Try increasing build memory limit if you're experiencing out-of-memory errors.
